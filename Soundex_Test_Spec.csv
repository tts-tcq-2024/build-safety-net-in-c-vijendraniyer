Test Case ID,Test Case Name,Test Case Description,Input,Expected Output,Status
TC01,Basic Name Test,"Check how the name ""Robert"" is turned into a special code. This helps us see if the program works for common names.",Robert,R163,Not Tested
TC02,Similar Names Test,"Test the name ""Rupert,"" which sounds a lot like ""Robert,"" to see if they both get the same code. This checks if similar names are treated the same.",Rupert,R163,Not Tested
TC03,Different Starting Letter Test,"Use the name ""William"" to see if it gets a different code since it starts with a different letter. This shows how the program handles different names.",William,W451,Not Tested
TC04,Vowel Handling Test,"Try the name ""Avery,"" which has some letters that are vowels. We want to see how the program treats these letters in the code.",Avery,A160,Not Tested
TC05,Case Sensitivity Test,"Check if the program can understand the name ""robert"" written in lowercase letters. This tests if it can tell that ""robert"" is the same as ""Robert."",robert""",R163,Not Tested,
TC06,Single Character Test,"Test with just the letter ""A"" to see what code it gives. This checks if the program can handle very short names.",A,A000,Not Tested
TC07,Empty Input Test,Use an empty string (no letters at all) to see what the program does. We want to check if it gives a default code when there’s nothing to work with.,,,Not Tested
TC08,NULL Input Test,Test what happens when we give the program nothing (NULL). We want to see if it can handle this without crashing.,NULL,0,Not Tested
TC09,Non-Alphabetic Characters Test,"Try the name ""J@ne!"" which has some funny characters like ""@"" and ""!"". This checks how the program deals with names that aren’t just letters.",J@ne!,J500,Not Tested
TC10,Hyphenated Name Test,"Use the name ""Smith-Jones,"" which has a dash in it, to see if the program can handle names with special characters like hyphens.",Smith-Jones,S535,Not Tested
TC11,Repeated Letters Test,"Test with the name ""Samantha,"" which has the letter ""A"" twice. We want to see if the program can avoid adding the same code twice.",Samantha,S530,Not Tested
TC12,Sequential Vowels Test,"Check the name ""Eddie,"" which has two vowels next to each other, to see how the program processes those letters in the code.",Eddie,E300,Not Tested
TC13,Long Name Test,"Try the longer name ""Christopher"" to see if the program can handle longer names and still give the right code.",Christopher,C632,Not Tested
